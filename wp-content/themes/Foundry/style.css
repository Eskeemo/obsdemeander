/*
FOUNDRY FRAMEWORK // style.css
====================================
This file is a standard WordPress file. In fact it is mandatory
if you want stuff to work. So the only reason it is included is
to prevent Wordpress from crashing.

The Foundry Framework is developed by combining and customizing several
great frameworks and starterkits, such as the bones framework by Eddie
Machado (htp://themble.com/bones) and the FoundationPress starter-theme
by Ole Fredrik (http://foundationpress.olefredrik.com).

/*
Unfortunately WordPress requires a style.css file located 
in the theme's root folder in order for stuff to work.
However, we don't do vanilla CSS. We're hip and happening
so we are using Sass.

Sass is a superset of CSS that adds in amazing features
such as variables, nested selectors and loops. It's also
the easiest way to customize Foundation 5. You can find
all these great Sass files in the library/scss folder.

Theme Check (http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/)
also is constantly telling me that it needs some classes 
in the CSS, even though they are in the REAL stylesheet,
located in the separate css folder. So we're gonna drop 
those classes here too, just to keep everybody happy. 
Great work, Theme Check (eye roll)
