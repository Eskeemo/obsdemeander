/*
Unfortunately WordPress requires a style.css file located 
in the theme's root folder in order for stuff to work.
However, we don't do vanilla CSS. We're hip and happening
so we are using Sass.

Sass is a superset of CSS that adds in amazing features
such as variables, nested selectors and loops. It's also
the easiest way to customize Foundation 5. You can find
all these great Sass files in the build/scss folder.

Theme Check (http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/)
also is constantly telling me that it needs some classes 
in the CSS, even though they are in the REAL stylesheet,
located in library/css/style.css. So we're gonna drop 
those classes here too, just to keep everybody happy. 
Great work, Theme Check (eye roll)
